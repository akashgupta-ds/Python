# High Level programming language
# Guido van Rossam => 1989 => National Research institute
# Country=> Netherland
# Python DOB=> 1991=> 20th Feb 1991=> official Launch to public

# First language
# python= Dynamically typed language
# C#, Java = Static typed
# Python Name comes from => Monty Python's circus => Popular Tv Show BBC => 1969-1974

# Python Installation

# Download from www.python.org
# for windows python 3.7 download
# Does not require configuration of path
# start
# path variable => system properties => environment path
# for java we require to add path but for python we don't need it
# Python REPL tool => Read + Evaluate + Print + Loop
# Python IDLE-
# 1. Edit plus editor -4.3
# 2. Notepad ++
# 3. Python Shell
# IDE's
# 1. pycharm
# 2. Spyder
# 3. Eclipse
# 4. Jupyter

# How it is built
# Functional programming from C
# OOPS from C++
# scripting language features from Perl and shell script
# Modular programming from Modula -3
# platform independent
# syntax from C & ABC language

# where we can use ?
# Desktop application
# Web Application (DJango)
# Database application
# For Networking application
# Games
# Data Analysis
# Machine learning application
# AI
# for IOT applications (Internet of Things)



# ------------- Features Of Python -----------------
# 1. Simple and Easy to learn
# 2. Freeware and Open Source
# 3. High level programming language
# 4. Platform independent [linux,windows,Mac]
# 5. Portability [ Migration of windows program to Machintosh Machine without any change]
# 6. Dynamically typed (does not require to declare type explicitly)
# 7. Both Procedure oriented and Object Oriented
# 8. Interpreted language
# 9. Extensible [ Other language programs use in python]
# 9.1 Existing code we can use in python for other language
# 9.2 We can improve the performance of the application
# 10. Embedded - Python prog are allowed to use in other language.
# 11. Rich library support- Extesive library

# ------------------ Limitation of Python -----------------
# 1. Performance [Due to Interpreted language]
# 2. Mobile applications

# ----------------- MYTH ----------------------------------
# Do Not support large enterprise application
# ---------------------------------------------------------

# Rules to define identifier in python---------------------
#----------------------------------------------------------
# 1. Alphabet symbols (both upper and lower) digits (0-9) , underscore(_)
# 2. Should not start with digits (0-9)
# 3. Identifiers are case sensitive
# 4. Keywords are not allowed
# 5. Max length for python identifier is no limit. But not recommended to take large identifier.[Too Lengthy]
# 6. __main__ is special variable
